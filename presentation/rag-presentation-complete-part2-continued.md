 RAG system
   - Document collection & processing pipeline

2. **Evaluation Framework**
   - Define metrics (accuracy, latency, relevance)
   - Establish testing protocols

3. **Scaling Considerations**
   - Performance optimization
   - Infrastructure planning

4. **User Feedback Loop**
   - Implement collection mechanisms
   - Iterative improvement process

<!-- 
SPEAKER NOTES:

Here's a proposed roadmap for our RAG implementation at NetApp.

First, we'll develop a prototype - a minimal viable RAG system with a basic document processing pipeline. This will let us test the concept with real documents and queries.

Next, we'll create an evaluation framework with defined metrics for accuracy, latency, and relevance. We'll establish testing protocols to ensure consistent measurement.

Once we've validated the prototype, we'll address scaling considerations. This includes performance optimization for handling larger document sets and infrastructure planning for deployment.

Finally, we'll implement user feedback mechanisms to continuously improve the system. This iterative approach will help us refine both the technical implementation and the user experience.

I propose we start with a small pilot in the customer support domain, where we can quickly demonstrate value and gather feedback before expanding to other areas.

SPEAKER NOTES:

Thank you all for your attention today!

We've covered the complete RAG workflow - from understanding what RAG is and why it's valuable, through the key components and implementation steps, to best practices and use cases.

The code and implementation guide we've discussed today are available in our GitHub repository, along with additional resources for deeper learning.

I believe RAG represents an opportunity for us at NetApp to enhance how we leverage our extensive technical documentation and knowledge bases, both internally and for our customers.

I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have about RAG implementation, specific use cases at NetApp, or next steps for our pilot project.

Thank you!
