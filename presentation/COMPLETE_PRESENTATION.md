# Complete RAG Presentation with Speaker Notes

To create the full presentation, you need to combine the following files:

1. `rag-presentation-final.md`
2. `rag-presentation-final2.md`

You can combine them using the following command:

### On Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
Get-Content rag-presentation-final.md, rag-presentation-final2.md | Set-Content rag-presentation-complete.md
```

### On macOS/Linux
```bash
cat rag-presentation-final.md rag-presentation-final2.md > rag-presentation-complete.md
```

The resulting file (`rag-presentation-complete.md`) will be a complete Marp presentation with:
- All presentation slides
- Detailed speaker notes for each slide
- Your name and company on the final slide

## Converting to PowerPoint

Once you have the complete file, follow the instructions in `CONVERSION_GUIDE.md` to convert it to PowerPoint format.

The simplest method is to use Marp CLI:

```bash
marp rag-presentation-complete.md --allow-local-files --output rag-presentation.pptx
```

Or use VS Code with the Marp extension for a visual preview and export.
