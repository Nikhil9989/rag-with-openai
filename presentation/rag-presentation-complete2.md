SPEAKER NOTES:

To continue learning about RAG, here are some valuable resources.

The OpenAI documentation is comprehensive and includes the API reference for all endpoints we'll use. The OpenAI Cookbook also provides practical examples and best practices.

For vector databases, each provider has detailed documentation. Pinecone, Weaviate, and Chroma all offer excellent guides. There are also performance benchmarks available that compare the different options.

The RAG frameworks we've mentioned - particularly LangChain and LlamaIndex - have extensive tutorials and examples. There are also many open-source RAG implementations on GitHub that we can learn from.

I recommend we start by exploring the LangChain documentation, which has specific guides for building RAG applications with different vector databases. Then we can dive deeper into OpenAI's embedding and completion API documentation.

I'll share links to all these resources in a follow-up email after this presentation.

# Resources & Next Steps

## Project Roadmap

1. **Prototype Development**
   - Build minimal viable RAG system
   - Document collection & processing pipeline

2. **Evaluation Framework**
   - Define metrics (accuracy, latency, relevance)
   - Establish testing protocols

3. **Scaling Considerations**
   - Performance optimization
   - Infrastructure planning

4. **User Feedback Loop**
   - Implement collection mechanisms
   - Iterative improvement process

<!-- 
SPEAKER NOTES:

Here's a proposed roadmap for our RAG implementation at NetApp.

First, we'll develop a prototype - a minimal viable RAG system with a basic document processing pipeline. This will let us test the concept with real documents and queries.

Next, we'll create an evaluation framework with defined metrics for accuracy, latency, and relevance. We'll establish testing protocols to ensure consistent measurement.

Once we've validated the prototype, we'll address scaling considerations. This includes performance optimization for handling larger document sets and infrastructure planning for deployment.

Finally, we'll implement user feedback mechanisms to continuously improve the system. This iterative approach will help us refine both the technical implementation and the user experience.

I propose we start with a small pilot in the customer support domain, where we can quickly demonstrate value and gather feedback before expanding to other areas.

SPEAKER NOTES:

Thank you all for your attention today!

We've covered the complete RAG workflow - from understanding what RAG is and why it's valuable, through the key components and implementation steps, to best practices and use cases.

The code and implementation guide we've discussed today are available in our GitHub repository, along with additional resources for deeper learning.

I believe RAG represents an opportunity for us at NetApp to enhance how we leverage our extensive technical documentation and knowledge bases, both internally and for our customers.

I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have about RAG implementation, specific use cases at NetApp, or next steps for our pilot project.

Thank you!
