# Building RAG with OpenAI

This repository contains a comprehensive guide and presentation materials for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems with OpenAI.

## Contents

- [Presentation](presentation/): PowerPoint presentation about RAG systems
- [Implementation Guide](implementation/): Step-by-step guide to building a RAG system
- [Code Examples](code/): Python code samples for RAG implementation

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant information from external knowledge sources before generating responses. This approach allows LLMs to access up-to-date information beyond their training data and provide more accurate, factual responses.

## Key Benefits

- Overcome knowledge cutoffs in LLMs
- Reduce hallucinations by grounding responses in facts
- Incorporate domain-specific knowledge
- Enhance transparency through source attribution
- Cost-effective alternative to full model fine-tuning

## Getting Started

To use this repository:

1. Clone the repository
2. Review the presentation materials
3. Follow the implementation guide to build your own RAG system
4. Explore code examples for practical implementations

## Prerequisites

- OpenAI API key
- Python 3.8+
- Basic understanding of NLP concepts
